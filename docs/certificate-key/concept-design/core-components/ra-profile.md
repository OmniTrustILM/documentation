# RA Profile

## What is `RA Profile`?

`RA Profile` is a representation of attributes that collectively provides a complete configuration of the certificate service which can be used by users and applications in a consistent and convenient way.

`RA Profile` provides an abstraction of the certificate management service configuration attributes:

- Certification Authority and its related information
- Certificate management technology-specific attributes
- Service-related configuration
- Access control configuration

Additionally, `RA Profile` uses the following attributes to identify the service:

- `RA Profile` Name
- Description

### Characteristics

Characteristics of `RA Profile` are:

- Binds the `Authority` and act as a specific certificate management service
- Configures the certificate specific attributes and defines the compliance rules and behavior
- Provide rules for issuing, renewing, and revocation of the certificate

### Process Flow

The following steps illustrate the process of requesting the certificate through the `RA Profile`:

1. `Client` requests the `RA Profile` to issue certificate providing the certificate signing request
2. `RA Profile` validates the certificate signing request against its configuration
3. `RA Profile` forwards the certificate signing request and related attributes to the `Authority Provider`
4. `Authority Provider` validates the certificate signing request and issues the certificate
5. `RA Profile` forwards the certificate to the `Client`

### Certificate Validation Settings

`RA Profile` can override platform certificate validation settings for certificates that are assigned to it. The following attributes are used to configure the certificate validation for the `RA Profile`:

| Name                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                         | Default Value |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Platform Validation Settings Used** | If enabled, platform settings will be used for validation of certificates associated with the RA Profile, otherwise RA Profile settings will be used for validation | `enabled`     |
| **Validation Enabled**                | Enable or disable validation of certificates associated with the RA Profile                                                                                         | `disabled`    |
| **Validation Frequency**              | Validation frequency of certificates associated with the RA Profile specified in days                                                                               | Everyday      |
| **Expiring Threshold**                | How many days before expiration should validation status of certificates associated with the RA Profile change to `Expiring`                                        | 30 days       |
